# Implementation Log: Task 1.3

**Summary:** Configured ESLint 9 with flat config format and Prettier for test code quality. Set up TypeScript ESLint plugin with recommended rules, Playwright plugin for test-specific linting, and Prettier config with 100-char line width. Fixed linting issues in existing files (removed unnecessary async, added return types). All tests pass with only 1 acceptable warning for skipped test.
