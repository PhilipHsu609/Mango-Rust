# Implementation Log: Task 5.2

**Summary:** Built final CSS with all refactoring changes complete. Build succeeded with no errors or warnings. Compiled CSS includes all changes: consistent @light-/@dark- variable naming, centralized _light-theme.less and _dark-theme.less files with correct selectors (body.uk-light and body.uk-dark), removed theme colors from base.less, and correct import order in main.less (variables → base → light-theme → components → pages → dark-theme).
