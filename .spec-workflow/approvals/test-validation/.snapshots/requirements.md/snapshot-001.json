The framework will inject specific bugs that each test is designed to catch, run the tests, and verify that the test fails as expected. Tests that pass despite the injected bug indicate gaps in test coverage and will be flagged for improvement.\n\nThis addresses a critical quality assurance need: ensuring our 50 integration tests (100% pass rate) are not just passing because there are no bugs, but because they would actually catch bugs if they existed.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis feature supports the testing and quality goals by:\n- **Quality Assurance**: Validates that tests provide real protection against regressions\n- **Confidence**: Ensures the 100% pass rate represents real reliability, not false positives\n- **Maintainability**: Identifies weak tests before they fail to catch real bugs in production\n- **Best Practices**: Implements mutation testing concepts to validate test effectiveness\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: Bug Injection Catalog\n\n**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want a systematic catalog of bugs to inject for each test case, so that I can validate test effectiveness comprehensively\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN analyzing a test case THEN the system SHALL identify the specific functionality being tested\n2. WHEN functionality is identified THEN the system SHALL define a minimal bug that would break that functionality\n3. WHEN a bug is defined THEN the system SHALL document the exact code change required to inject the bug\n4. IF a test has multiple assertions THEN the system SHALL create separate bugs for each assertion\n5. WHEN cataloging bugs THEN the system SHALL include:\n   - Test file path and test name\n   - Functionality being tested\n   - Source file(s) to modify\n   - Exact code change to inject the bug\n   - Expected test failure message/symptom\n\n### Requirement 2: Automated Bug Injection\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated bug injection into source code, so that I can quickly validate tests without manual code editing\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN injecting a bug THEN the system SHALL create a git branch for the bug injection\n2. WHEN creating a branch THEN the branch SHALL be named `test-validation/{test-name}/{bug-id}`\n3. WHEN modifying source files THEN the system SHALL apply the exact code change from the catalog\n4. IF the code change cannot be applied THEN the system SHALL report an error with details\n5. WHEN injection is complete THEN the system SHALL verify the source file was modified correctly\n\n### Requirement 3: Test Execution and Validation\n\n**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want automated test execution after bug injection, so that I can verify if the test catches the bug\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a bug is injected THEN the system SHALL run ONLY the specific test case being validated\n2. WHEN running the test THEN the system SHALL capture the exit code and full output\n3. IF the test passes THEN the system SHALL mark the test as \"WEAK\" (failed to detect bug)\n4. IF the test fails THEN the system SHALL mark the test as \"STRONG\" (successfully detected bug)\n5. WHEN test completes THEN the system SHALL record:\n   - Test result (pass/fail)\n   - Test validation status (STRONG/WEAK)\n   - Test output/error message\n   - Time taken\n\n### Requirement 4: Branch Cleanup\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic cleanup of test validation branches, so that the repository stays clean\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN test validation completes THEN the system SHALL switch back to the original branch\n2. WHEN returning to original branch THEN the system SHALL delete the validation branch\n3. IF cleanup fails THEN the system SHALL report the error but continue with other tests\n4. WHEN all validations complete THEN the system SHALL verify no validation branches remain\n\n### Requirement 5: Validation Report Generation\n\n**User Story:** As a QA lead, I want a comprehensive validation report, so that I can identify which tests need improvement\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN all tests are validated THEN the system SHALL generate a markdown report\n2. WHEN generating the report THEN the system SHALL include:\n   - Total tests validated\n   - Number of STRONG tests (passed validation)\n   - Number of WEAK tests (failed validation)\n   - Detailed results for each test with bug injection details\n3. IF a test is WEAK THEN the report SHALL include:\n   - What bug was injected\n   - Why the test should have failed\n   - Suggestions for improving the test\n4. WHEN report is complete THEN the system SHALL save it to `.spec-workflow/specs/test-validation/validation-report.md`\n5. WHEN report is saved THEN the system SHALL display a summary to the user\n\n### Requirement 6: Test Improvement Recommendations\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want specific recommendations for improving weak tests, so that I can fix them effectively\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. IF a test is marked WEAK THEN the system SHALL analyze why it didn't detect the bug\n2. WHEN analyzing a weak test THEN the system SHALL check:\n   - Missing assertions\n   - Insufficient verification depth\n   - Incorrect assertion expectations\n3. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide specific code suggestions\n4. WHEN suggesting improvements THEN the system SHALL include:\n   - What assertion to add\n   - What value/behavior to verify\n   - Example code snippet\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Separate modules for bug catalog, injection, execution, and reporting\n- **Modular Design**: Bug definitions should be data-driven (JSON/YAML) not hardcoded\n- **Dependency Management**: Minimize coupling between validation framework and test code\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined contracts between bug injection and test execution phases\n\n### Performance\n- Tests should run in parallel where possible (max 8 concurrent as per Playwright config)\n- Total validation time for 50 tests should not exceed 30 minutes\n- Git operations should be batched to minimize overhead\n\n### Security\n- Bug injection must NEVER affect files outside the project directory\n- All git branches must be local-only (never push validation branches)\n- Original code must be fully restored after validation\n\n### Reliability\n- System must handle test failures gracefully without leaving repository in dirty state\n- If validation crashes mid-run, repository must be recoverable to clean state\n- All git operations must be atomic and reversible\n\n### Usability\n- Clear progress indicators during validation (e.g., \"Validating test 23/50...\")\n- Colored output to distinguish STRONG vs WEAK tests\n- Final report should be human-readable with actionable insights\n",
