# Mango-Rust

A self-hosted manga reader written in Rust, porting the original [Mango](https://github.com/getmango/Mango) project from Crystal.

## About

Mango-Rust is a modern reimplementation of the excellent Mango manga server, originally created by [hkalexling](https://github.com/hkalexling). This port aims to bring Mango's functionality to Rust while maintaining compatibility with the original's design philosophy and user experience.

**Credit**: This project is based on [Mango](https://github.com/getmango/Mango) by hkalexling and contributors. The original project laid the groundwork for this Rust implementation.

## Current Status

🚀 **Active Development** - Core functionality complete, enhancement features in progress.

### Completed Features

- ✅ User authentication and session management
- ✅ Library scanning and indexing (ZIP/CBZ support)
- ✅ Web-based manga reader (paged and continuous modes)
- ✅ Reading progress tracking and resume functionality
- ✅ Thumbnail generation and caching
- ✅ Search and sorting

### In Progress

- 🚧 Admin panel
- 🚧 Collections and tags
- 🚧 OPDS support

### Planned

- ⏳ Plugin system
- ⏳ Download queue
- ⏳ RAR/CBR archive support
- ⏳ Theme customization

## Prerequisites

- Rust 1.91.0 or later
- SQLite 3

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mango-rust.git
cd mango-rust

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Run the server
cargo run --release
```

On first run, Mango will:
1. Create config file at `~/.config/mango/config.yml`
2. Initialize the database at `~/mango/mango.db`
3. Create an admin user with a random password (shown in logs)

## Configuration

Configuration file location: `~/.config/mango/config.yml`

```yaml
host: 0.0.0.0
port: 9000
base_url: /
library_path: ~/mango/library
db_path: ~/mango/mango.db
log_level: info
scan_interval_minutes: 5
```

### Environment Variables

You can override configuration with environment variables:

- `MANGO_HOST` - Server host (default: 0.0.0.0)
- `MANGO_PORT` - Server port (default: 9000)
- `MANGO_BASE_URL` - Base URL path (default: /)
- `MANGO_LIBRARY_PATH` - Manga library directory
- `MANGO_DB_PATH` - Database file path
- `MANGO_LOG_LEVEL` - Logging level (trace/debug/info/warn/error)

## Usage

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

2. Open your browser to `http://localhost:9000`

3. Login with the admin credentials shown in the server logs on first run

4. Change the admin password immediately after first login

## Development

```bash
# Run in development mode with hot reload
cargo watch -x run

# Run tests
cargo test

# Check code without building
cargo check

# Format code
cargo fmt

# Run linter
cargo clippy
```
